## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Question 1

Count the types of things I’m doing online (column “transType” in the wbdata). What is my most frequent type of interaction with the web?


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
wbdata <- jsonlite::fromJSON(gzcon(url("https://github.com/cjbarrie/CS-ED/blob/main/data/web_historian_data.json?raw=true")))
wbdata %>%
  group_by(transType) %>%
  count() %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

## Question 2

Change the colour of the bars in the bar graph.

```{r}
library(jsonlite)
library(dplyr)
wbdata <- jsonlite::fromJSON(gzcon(url("https://github.com/cjbarrie/CS-ED/blob/main/data/web_historian_data.json?raw=true")))

wbdata_mp <- wbdata %>% 
  group_by(domain) %>%
  count() %>%
  filter(n >5)

wbdata_mp %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(domain, n), stat = "identity", fill = "blue") +
  coord_flip()
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
